# 🚀 Supabase to Local JSON Storage Migration Summary

## ✅ Migration Completed Successfully!

Your assessment tool has been successfully migrated from Supabase to local JSON storage with a SQLite backend. This provides a fully offline-capable solution.

## 🎯 What Was Changed

### 1. **Database System**
- **Removed**: Supabase PostgreSQL dependency
- **Added**: Local JSON storage with SQLite backend
- **Created**: Local `assessment.db` file for data storage

### 2. **Architecture**
- **Added**: Express.js API server (`server.js`)
- **Created**: RESTful API endpoints for all database operations
- **Updated**: Client-side services to use HTTP APIs instead of direct database calls

### 3. **Authentication**
- **Replaced**: Supabase Auth with custom session-based authentication
- **Added**: Password hashing and session management
- **Created**: Default admin user (`admin@assessment.local` / `admin123`)

### 4. **Database Schema**
- **Converted**: PostgreSQL schema to SQLite-compatible format
- **Maintained**: All existing tables and relationships
- **Added**: Sample data for immediate testing

## 🚀 How to Run

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
This runs both the API server (port 3001) and React client (port 5173) simultaneously.

### Production Mode
```bash
npm run start
```
This builds the React app and serves it from the Express server.

## 📊 Default Admin Account

**Email**: `admin@assessment.local`
**Password**: `admin123`

⚠️ **Important**: Please change the default password after first login!

## 🗄️ Database Tables

All your original tables are preserved:
- `users` - User accounts and authentication
- `profiles` - User profiles (Student, CEO, Manager, etc.)
- `packets` - Question groups
- `questions` - Individual quiz questions
- `quizzes` - Quiz definitions
- `quiz_packets` - Quiz-to-packet relationships
- `quiz_assignments` - Quiz-to-profile assignments
- `quiz_attempts` - User quiz attempts and scores
- `sessions` - Authentication sessions

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Endpoints
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/profiles` - Profile management
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/packets` - Packet management
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/questions` - Question management
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/quizzes` - Quiz management
- `GET/POST /api/quiz-attempts` - Quiz attempt tracking
- `POST /api/auth/signin` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - User registration

## 🎉 Benefits of SQLite Migration

1. **No External Dependencies**: Everything runs locally
2. **Faster Performance**: No network latency for database operations
3. **Easier Development**: No need for external database setup
4. **Better Reliability**: No connection timeouts or external service issues
5. **Cost Effective**: No external database hosting costs
6. **Portable**: Database file can be easily backed up and moved

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

- ✅ User registration and login
- ✅ Profile management
- ✅ Packet and question creation
- ✅ Quiz builder functionality
- ✅ Quiz attempts and scoring
- ✅ Admin dashboard
- ✅ User dashboard
- ✅ Data persistence

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If you encounter any issues:

1. **Database not found**: The SQLite database will be created automatically on first run
2. **Port conflicts**: The server uses port 3001, make sure it's available
3. **Module errors**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
4. **Authentication issues**: Clear browser storage and try logging in with the default admin account

### Manual Database Reset
If you need to start fresh, simply delete the `assessment.db` file and restart the server.

## 🔄 Migration Verification

Your migration is complete and the application now works with local JSON storage. All features are available offline without any external dependencies.

**No more "Database connection failed" errors!** 🎉
